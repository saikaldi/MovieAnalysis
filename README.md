# Movie Dataset Analysis Project

## Project Overview

This project involves a detailed analysis of a movie dataset using Python and Pandas. The aim is to clean, preprocess, and visualize the data to uncover patterns, trends, and key insights within the cinematic data landscape. Through this analysis, various aspects of movie performance, trends, and industry impacts are explored, demonstrating expertise in data wrangling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and data visualization.

## Objectives

- **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**  
  Streamline the dataset by removing unnecessary columns, handling missing values, and creating new columns for enhanced analysis.

- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualize key metrics such as movie popularity, average ratings, and return on investment (ROI) over time to identify significant trends.

- **Data Visualization:**  
  Employ various visualization techniques to present data insights effectively, including histograms, scatter plots, and treemaps.

## Key Steps and Insights

- **Removing Unnecessary Columns:**  
  Eliminated columns that did not contribute to the analysis, making the dataset more manageable and focused.

- **Handling Missing Data:**  
  Addressed NULL values by removing rows with critical missing data and replacing NULL values with zeros where appropriate.

- **Creating Additional Columns:**  
  Added new columns to the dataset to facilitate more in-depth analysis and insights.

- **Visualizing Data Distribution:**  
  Used histograms to explore the distribution of data in selected columns, revealing key trends and patterns.
